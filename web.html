    As of late, we have finished our first ever collaborative story, which focuses on an adolescent boy who wonders if there is a greater purpose for him than residing in the underground cave he calls home.  Written by all nine members, we learned about adapting personal style and preference for the betterment of the narrative.  However, we must warn you that the style is rather strange and rushed at some moments as we were working towards a very short deadline.
    Please keep this mind and enjoy the madness that is our community!  (Don't say we didn't warn you....)
